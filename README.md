Hello! This project is a part of the Winter 2024 ITGCA: Integrated Training in Computational Genomics and Data Sciences!
We studied and looked into Helianthus argophyllus (also known as silver leaf sunflower) and analyzes the differences between their gene expression, which we theorized as a result of their environmental pressure.
The following scripts in this repository allow us to run the RNA sequence data in bash and finally express as graphs in R studio.
